# ensembleMLBP
EnsembleMLBP is a ECE511 course project created by Vikram, Umur and Andrew. Here we explore ensemble+ML based branch predictor. Initially we analyse tournamentBP and provide it loopholes. Then we evaluate weighted majority selection scheme for TournamentBP.

There are several commands to run different kinds of benchmarks. 

Command : 
 gem5/run.sh 

Benchmark: 
 compile : 
     script/run.sh
