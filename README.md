# ensembleMLBP
EnsembleMLBP is a ECE511 course project created by Vikram, Umur and Andrew. Here we explore ensemble+ML based branch predictor. Initially we analyse tournamentBP and provide it loopholes. In second half we discuss RNN-LSTM and reinforcement learning schemes for BP. More details of the project will be added soon. The project is in early stage of development.
